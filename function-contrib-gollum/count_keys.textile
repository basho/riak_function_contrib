h1. Map Phase to Count Keys

[[Source File on GitHub|https://github.com/basho/riak_function_contrib/blob/master/mapreduce/js/count_keys.js]]  

This function counts records in a given bucket with MapReduce. There are two phases to the map reduce. The below function provides the map phase and should be combined with the Riak.reduceSum to provide the number of keys in the bucket.




```js
function mapCount() {
  return [1]
}
```

h1. Pre- and Post-Commit Functions

This is a list of all the MapReduce Functions that have been contributed to the repo. These links will take you to author-provided information about the functions along with a link to a the source file in the [[Riak Function Contrib Repo|https://github.com/basho/riak_function_contrib/]]. 

The file names _should_ reflect the nature of the function, so look to that for an idea of how it might help you and what you can use it for. Whether a function is a Pre- or Post-Commit Hook is specified at the end of the name.

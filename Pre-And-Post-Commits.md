# Pre- and Post-Commit Functions

This is a list of all the MapReduce Functions that have been contributed to the repo. These links will take you to author-provided information about the functions along with a link to a the source file in the [Riak Function Contrib Repo](https://github.com/basho/riak_function_contrib). 

The file names _should_ reflect the nature of the function, so look to that for an idea of how it might help you and what you can use it for. Whether a function is a Pre- or Post-Commit Hook is specified at the end of the name. 

Have a Pre- or Post-Commit Hook Function to contribute? Check out [the contribution guidelines](https://github.com/basho/riak_function_contrib) to get started.

For more information on using hooks in your environment please reference the [Riak docs](http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/developing/usage/commit-hooks).

# ISO8601 handling

[Source File on GitHub](https://github.com/basho/riak_function_contrib/blob/master/mapreduce/js/iso8601.js)

Loading `iso8601.js` extends the `Date` prototype with two functions: `setISO8601` and `iso8601`, and adds a parsing helper: `Date.iso8601`. As `ISO8601` W3C profile is one of the most common ways to serialize dates and times in JSON, you may find this useful.

## Example Usage

Convert a `Date` to an ISO8601 representation:

```javascript
(new Date()).iso8601();    // "2011-02-19T18:30:56.076Z"
```

Convert an ISO8601 string to a `Date`:

```javascript
Date.iso8601("2011-02-19T18:30:56.076Z");    // Sat Feb 19 2011 10:30:56 GMT-0800 (PST)
```

## Notes

`Date.prototype.setISO8601` is provided for consistency with the other `Date` prototype functions. It takes an ISO8601 string, sets the receiver's value to the date represented therein, and returns undefined.

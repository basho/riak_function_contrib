# Map Reduce Functions

This is a list of all the MapReduce Functions that have been contributed to the repo. These links will take you to author-provided information about the functions along with a link to a the source file in the [Riak Function Contrib Repo](https://github.com/basho/riak_function_contrib).

The file names _should_ reflect the nature of the function, so look to that for an idea of how it might help you and what you can use it for. The language in which the function is written is specified in parentheses at the end of the name.

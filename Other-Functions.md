# Other Functions or Scripts

This is a list of other functions, such as utilities, that can be used from a Riak console to accomplish tasks such as data export, transferring data between clusters, or other operations useful when operating a Riak cluster. 

The file names _should_ reflect the nature of the function, so look to that for an idea of how it might help you and what you can use it for.

Have a function or script you would like to contribute? Check out the [the contribution guidelines](https://github.com/basho/riak_function_contrib) and send it our way. We would love to have it.

For more information on using these functions in your environment please reference the [[usage|Usage]] section.
